## Weather Website

I have made a real-time weather tracking website using HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.In this website the user should just enter the city name of which he should find the weather,
it provides the current weather in celsius in real-time.I have did this by integrating with openmaps api.
The outputs looks like this
